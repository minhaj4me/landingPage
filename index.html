    <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
    <p class="overview">On paper, the supercar-bred, 641-hp Lamborghini Urus sounds overmatched against the 707-hp,
        Hellcat-powered
        <strong>Jeep
            Grand Cherokee Trackhawk</strong>. However, only one of these outrageous machines owns the crown as the
        <strong>quickest SUV we've
            ever run</strong> at Virginia International Raceway in our annual Lightning Lap event. For those who
        couldn’t
        guess, it's the
        Lambo, which costs nearly a quarter-million dollars. That's the entry price to own a wildly styled SUV of this
        pedigree. Along with unbelievable track skills for its size, the Urus offers some things that the
        <strong>Lamborghini
            Aventador</strong> and <strong>Huracán </strong> don't: a back seat, useable cargo space, and the ability to
        tow. While its interior
        craftsmanship isn't as good as its supercar siblings’, and it's the very definition of a gas-guzzler, the 2022
        Lamborghini Urus is easily the most badass family hauler on the planet.
    </p>
    <h2>What's New for 2022?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>For 2022, <strong>Lamborghini</strong> doesn't make any notable changes to the Urus. The super SUV is still
        powered
        by a 641-hp twin-turbo V-8 that pairs with an eight-speed automatic and all-wheel drive. The Italian automaker
        is
        known for introducing limited-edition models and special appearance packs, any of which could be added during
        the
        model year.
        Although the Urus costs close to a quarter of a million dollars, it's still the least costly Lamborghini you can
        buy. Add the fact that it can haul more than two people and an ample amount of luggage and it's also the best
        value
        in the Italian company's lineup. Our recommended version would play up its highly extroverted style with the new
        Pearl Capsule appearance package. We especially like it in the Verde Mantis green paint, which is offset by
        black
        exterior details and huge 23-inch wheels. The interior color scheme is set to match. We'd add the front seats
        with
        ventilation and massage functions for increased luxury, and we'd switch to the four-seat configuration that
        reduces
        passenger capacity by one but brings rear-seat power adjustments and heated surfaces. We assume rich people
        don't
        want to ride three-deep in the back seat anyway. The other options we'd choose are the upgraded sound system,
        hands-free tailgate, rear-seat entertainment system, and the available Off-Road drive modes.
